Hence the above recipe will fill one oversize Martini or two regular coupe glasses.\nIf you've a bone dry palate and would like to sample a true Hemingway Special without the addition of sugar then this is the authentic recipe given to us by Alejandro Bolívar Rodriguez, Head Bartender at El Floridita, Havana, Cuba.\nDaiquiri Hemingway\nGlass: Hurricane\nGarnish: Straw\nMethod: BLEND all ingredients with crushed ice for five seconds.\n90ml / 3oz Light Cuban rum\n5ml / 1 spoon Maraschino liqueur\n30ml / 1oz Grapefruit juice\n15ml / 1/2oz Lime juice",
      "history": "Created by Constantino (Constante) Ribalaigua Vert, the legendary head bartender of La Floridita, Havana, Cuba for Ernest Hemingway, after the great man wandered into the bar to use the toilet. When Hemingway tried the Floridita's standard frozen Daiquiri, he is quoted as saying, \"That's good but I prefer it without sugar and with double rum\" - so the Hemingway Special was born.\nHemingway suffered from haemochromatosis (a rare hereditary disease that can lead to diabetes) from which his father also suffered, hence his aversion to sugar. The original version was exactly as Hemingway requested a Daiquiri without sugar and heavy on the rum, basically rum shaken with a splash of lime juice. Years later after he took over the position of Head Bartender at La Floridita, Antonio Meilan added maraschino and grapefruit juice into the drink. Today sugar is commonly also added to balance this drink and make it more palatable to people with less sour palates than Hemingway.\nHemingway was affectionately known as 'Papa' in Cuba and this drink was originally named 'Daiquiri Like Papa' and then later 'Papa Doble'. After Meilan added maraschino and grapefruit the drink changed its name again to the Hemingway Special we recognise today.\nDedicated Daiquiri cocktail information, including variants, history and best recipes is available in our Daiquiri cocktail area."

Marketed under the trademarked strapline \"New Orleans Most Powerful Drink\" and, since 1992, served in long plastic half-yard hand-grenade shaped vessels, this green melon flavoured proprietary drink is available as a pre-mix by mail order from tropicalisle.com. The recipe used to make this and the cocktails served in the Tropical Isle bars is a well-kept secret.\nBeware, in the USA the operators of Tropical Isle have trademarked Hand Grenade so preventing other establishments not licensed by Tropical Isle from selling cocktails of this name."

Of the many stories surrounding its origin, perhaps the most credible attributes its creation to sometime in the late 1970s by Robert \"Rosebud\" Butt at Oak Beach Inn in Babylon, New York. This area of New York State is known as Long Island and the drink resembles an iced tea, so disguising its alcoholic contents – a fact that has many claiming its true origins go back to Prohibition."

      "review": "In 1934, Victor Jules Bergeron, or Trader Vic as he became known, opened his first restaurant in Oakland, San Francisco. He served Polynesian food with a mix of Chinese, French and American dishes cooked in wood-fired ovens. But he is best known for the rum based cocktails he created.\nOne evening, in 1944, he tested a new drink on two friends from Tahiti, Ham and Carrie Guild. After the first sip, Carrie is said to have exclaimed, \"mai tai-roa aé\", which in Tahitian means 'out of this world - the best!'. So Bergeron named his drink the Mai Tai.\nVic's original Mai Tai was based on 17 year old Jamaican J.Wray & Nephew rum, which in his own book he describes as being \"surprisingly golden in colour, medium-bodied, but with the rich pungent flavour particular to the Jamaican blends\". Vic's recipe calls for \"rock candy\" syrup, an old term for the type of strong sugar syrup we prescribe here at Difford's Guide: two parts sugar to one part water. The term 'rock candy' referred to the fact that you could dangle a piece of string in the syrup to encourage crystallisation and make rock candy.\nThis recipe is adapted from Victor Bergeron's Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide (1972 revised edition), the original 1944 formula is:\n2 ounces of 17-year old J. Wray & Nephew Rum\nJuice from one fresh lime\n1/2 ounce Holland DeKuyper Orange Curacao\n1/4 ounce Trader Vic's Rock Candy Syrup\n1/2 ounce French Garier Orgeat Syrup\nShake vigorously over shaved ice and garnish with a mint sprig.\nA more detailed history of this drink, along with its variants can be found on our Mai Tai cocktail page."

Poister's 1989 The New American Bartender's Guide confirms this Tiki-style cocktail as originating at the Kuala Lumpur Hilton where it was created as the welcome drink for the hotel's opening on 6th July 1973 by the Beverage Manager, Jeffrey Ong.\nThe New American Bartender's Guide specifies the following recipe:\n1½ oz Dark rum\n¾ oz Campari\n4 oz Pineapple juice\n½ oz Lime juice\n½ oz Sugar syrup or to taste\nWith the instruction to mix all ingredients \"with cracked ice in a shaker or blender and serve in a special ceramic-bird container or use a chilled Hurricane glass. Garnish with a cherry, orange and lemon slice, and an orchid.\"\nThe hotel's bar was called Aviary, so the Jungle Bird name was appropriate, particularly as guests could see birds kept in a netted area near the swimming pool through a glass panel in the bar. The birds were eventually freed by the hotel's Colombian General Manager, Ricardo Tapia, while the hotel itself became the Crowne Plaza Mutiara before eventually being demolished in 2013 to make way for development.\nThe cocktail was originally served in a ceramic bird vessel sipped from an opening in the tail, and then latterly, perhaps due to thefts of the original vessel, in stemmed wine goblet with an engraved bird on the side.\nThe rediscovery and popularity of the Jungle Bird was much helped by its appearance in Jeff \"Beachbum\" Berry's influential Intoxica book. Indeed, it has since become something of a national cocktail in Malaysia, as by reported Kim Choong in the country's ThirstMag.com from where much of the above is based.\nJeffrey Ong passed away, something of a national hero, on 26th February 2019 aged 71 with the national newspaper describing him as \"the creator of Malaysia's only internationally recognised classic cocktail.\""

This slightly clouds the appearance of the drink but the hint of fruit freshens, helps balance and lift the heavy Fernet Branca. A dash of orange juice crept into our recipe for the Hanky Panky around 2010 but sadly we didn't record who or what occasion inspired this variation."

Extinguish flame by covering flaming tankard with base of the other tankard, pour into glass and sweeten to taste by stirring in powdered sugar.\nWARNING - please practice with water first to perfect your method.

      "review": "Created in the 1980s by Dick Bradsell, London, England. In the Dec-Jan 1998 edition of CLASS magazine (page 6), Dick wrote about his drink, \"Many springs ago, I conceived the Russian Spring Punch which is basically a spiked Kir Royal over ice. This conforms to the punch formula of 1 sweet, 2 sour, 3 strong, 4 weak except the most of the 'weak' bit (normally soda or juice) is replaced with champagne, turning the recipe into a sledgehammer of a cocktail. To make, fill a Collins glass with ice. Add 50ml best vodka, 25ml lemon juice, two teaspoons of cassis and two teaspoons of sugar syrup. Top with champagne and stir. Garnish with a lemon slice and some berries.\"\nIn August 2015, Dick told us the full story: \"I created this drink for friends of ours, Rebecca du Pont de Bie and Peter Kent, in the 80s. I think I was still working at Zanzibar at the time, but it might very well have been Fred's: it was before my daughter Beatrix was born in 1988.\nPeter was a gay guy, who designed shops and married Hamish Bowles, who is editor-at-large for Vogue. They shared an extremely nice flat in the Knightsbridge end of Kensington, and they wanted to have a cocktail party but they didn't have enough money.\nSo I suggested that, as they didn't have quite enough cash for prestigious amounts of drink, they requested that everyone brought a bottle of bubbly. So if you brought rubbish, you got the drinks rubbish, and if you brought quality, you drank quality.\nI stocked the bar with glasses, and in each glass was a shot of vodka, half a shot of lemon juice, two barspoons of sugar, one barspoon of cassis and ice. People got to drink their whole bottle of champagne and however many shots of vodka they felt they could manage.\nIt was lethal, that thing. We had people falling down the stairs and dancing around in wild abandon. I called it the Russian Spring Punch because it has vodka in it, which is Russian, and it's a Collins, or a Fizz, which is a spring drink.\""
